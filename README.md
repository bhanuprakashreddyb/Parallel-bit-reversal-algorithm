# Parallel-bit-reversal-algorithm
In this algorithm, the data is given parallely using two inputs (i.e., x1,x2).
The output must also be taken parallely, but in bit reversal order.
Bit reversal is a technique used to reverse the binary number (Eg- 0010 -> 0100).
The three main blocks in the module are taking input from the user, performing the bit reversal on the index values and printing the output in the bit reversed manner.
